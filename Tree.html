  <h1 class="heading">Tree</h1>
  <p>A tree is a hierarchical data structure that represents a collection of elements. It consists of nodes connected by edges, where each node can have zero or more child nodes.</p>
  <p>In a tree, there is a special node called the root, which is the topmost node and has no parent. The nodes below the root are called child nodes, and each child node can have its own child nodes, forming a hierarchical structure.</p>
  <p>Each node in a tree can have at most one parent node, except for the root node, which has no parent. The nodes that have the same parent are called siblings. Nodes that have no child nodes are called leaf nodes, while nodes with at least one child node are called internal nodes.</p>
  <h2>Properties of Trees</h2>
  <ul>
   <li><strong>Root:</strong> The topmost node of the tree.</li>
   <li><strong>Child:</strong> A node directly connected to another node when moving away from the root.</li>
   <li><strong>Parent:</strong> A node directly connected to another node when moving towards the root.</li>
   <li><strong>Sibling:</strong> Nodes that share the same parent.</li>
   <li><strong>Leaf:</strong> Nodes that have no child nodes.</li>
   <li><strong>Internal Node:</strong> Nodes that have at least one child node.</li>
   <li><strong>Depth:</strong> The number of edges from the root to a specific node.</li>
   <li><strong>Height:</strong> The maximum depth of any node in the tree.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Example</h2>
  <p>Here's an example of a tree representing a file system:</p>
  <img align="right" src="Tree.png" alt=""><br><br>
  <p>In this example, the root node represents the main folder, and it has three child nodes: two files and one folder. The folder node, in turn, has three child nodes: two files and another folder.</p>
  <p>Trees are commonly used to represent hierarchical relationships and recursive structures. They provide efficient ways to organize and access data, making them useful in various applications such as file systems, organizational charts, decision-making processes, and data organization in databases.</p>
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>Trees are a fundamental data structure in computer science. They allow us to represent and manage hierarchical relationships between elements. Understanding trees and their properties, such as the root, nodes, edges, and the hierarchy they create, is crucial for solving problems that involve organizing and accessing structured data efficiently.</p>
